The volume of data recorded by current and
future scientific experiments such as those in High Energy Physics & Astrophysics,
and the complexity of their data set require a broad panel of
knowledge in computer science, signal processing, statistics, and physics.
Exact analysis of those data sets produced is a serious computational challenge,
which cannot be done without the help of state-of-the-art tools.
This has to be matched by sophisticated and robust analysis performed on many
powerful machines, as we need to process or simulate several times data sets.

AstroLab Software is an organisation aiming at providing state-of-the-art software tools to overcome modern science challenges faced by research groups.
Sharing R&D efforts between groups, improving interoperability between industry and research in open source projects, and developing new collaborative tools will allow research communities to more fully exploit the big data ecosystem tools.

## How to contribute?

Feel free to contribute to the effort! You can fork and push to the projects, or let us know if you use our projects for your work. For students, we have from time-to-time internship positions, so do not hesitate to contact us if you want to work with us!
We also participate to the Google Summer of Code program.
